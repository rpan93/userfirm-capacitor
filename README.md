# userfirm-capacitor
This is a simple test with capacitor to call a simple api: https://dev-ms.worldpay.com/userfirm. Actually this applies to any other https endpoints.

Use these command:
ionic build
npx cap add android
npx cap open android

in Android studio, run the app. The API handshaking failed.
